# Hello-World
To understand better what this is all aabout
I am who God said I am! I am the head and not the tail. 
I am the first and not the last. 
Everything I lay my hand on shall prosper. 
I will excel in all I do. 
Things are working for me! 
Things are getting better.
Holy Spirit is my Senior Partner; He direct, guide, instruct and lead me in all I do.
My sins are forgiving.
I am blessed; My seeds are blessed!
